# Module 1 essentials 
### Problems to do. Turn in next Tuesday. 
### An in-class 💦 mini-exam Tuesday (30 minutes) will ask a few of these key points, so make sure they actually go in your head, and you understand them. 

1. Know the word _deviation_ or _perturbation_ (indicating that the _mean_ of your set of numbers has been subtracted). Know that in our field, _anomaly_ means a deviation from a _time_ average, while _eddy_ means a deviation from a _spatial_ average. Know the adjective  _standardized_ (indicating a deviation that has been divided by the _standard deviation_: this makes standardized variables _unitless_). 

2. You should understand the following: 

  a. The _value of a standardized variable_ is also called a _Z-score_. A **score** is a number used in a test for 'statistical significance', which is a meaasure of the _confidence_ you should have in some _claim_ based on data. The Z-score is used in the [_Z test_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-test). When your sample is small (N<20 or so), you should instead use the _t-score_ (which is a function of N, as well as of the standardized value; it asymptotes to the Z-score for large N). The t-score is used in the [_Student's t-test_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test), the most famous test in statistics. 
  
  b. These _tests_ estimate the [p-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value), which is _the probability that a **randomly generated** score **if the null hypothesis were true**_ would be of _equal or greater magnitude_ than the **actual score**  you are testing before your claim can be declared 'statistically significant'. That is, you are testing whether your data _falsifies your null hypothesis._ This is a weak and roundabout measure of the strength of evidence, and requires you to **explicily define your null hypothesis**. A serious student should laugh at [this cartoon](https://xkcd.com/882/); and more seriously should read and ponder [this paper](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/2010JCLI3746.1) or other recent works on the [replication crisis in science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis), which partly attributed to the disreputable (but tempting) process of [_p-hacking_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging). Understand this [cartoon](https://xkcd.com/1478/) and _don't be that person!_

3. Know about linear correlation and regression: Know the definitions of cov(X,Y) = cov(Y,X), std(X) and std(Y), and _r_ (the correlation coefficient). Know the definitions of reg(Y,X) and reg(X,Y), which are **not equal**. Know that the _fraction of variance explained by the linear regression term_ is equal to the **square of r**. 

4. Know the _principle of least squares_. Show that it is equivalent to the principle that _the regression term captures all of the linear relationship with the "predictor" (or "independent") variable_, so that _the residual is uncorrelated with the predictor variable_. Know how to explain these principles in your own words -- that is, how to _convince me_ that you really understand them **correctly and completely** -- with extra stars for expressing that _concisely_. 

5. Do the worksheet (ExamAssignment.ipynb) which has the proper math symbols that this .md file can't display. 

### Vocabulary tables: 

#### Data terms: Simple statistics and regression
Term | Formula: use sets {X<sub>i</sub>}; use primes and bars like X̅, X̅'̅Y̅'̅; or use cor(X,Y), cov(X,Y), std(Y), var(Y). For the mini-exam be ready to use both, and also to write the summation notation (Σ for sums) if need be. Also write the _meaning_. Overline ̅.
